   * While RTL doesn't directly test tab order in a browser, we can check for attributes
   * that enable keyboard interaction (like `tabIndex` if not implicitly focusable, or role).
   * Since these are `div` elements with `onClick`, they should ideally have `role="button"` and `tabIndex="0"`
   * for better accessibility, or be actual `<button>` elements.
   * For this test, we'll focus on the click interaction which implies they are interactive.
   * Note: Full accessibility testing often involves manual testing or specialized tools.
   * The current implementation relies on divs with onClick, which are generally accessible
   * for mouse users but might need explicit `role` and `tabIndex` for optimal keyboard navigation.
   * This test primarily re-verifies the clickability, which is a proxy for basic interactivity.
